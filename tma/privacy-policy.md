## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how the Tree Plantation Monitoring System ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our mobile application ("App").

**Developer Notice:** This app was developed by **ArkVerse Private Limited** for an individual client who is the sole owner and data controller of all user data collected through the app. While ArkVerse acts as the technical provider, the individual client is fully responsible for the data, including storage, access, and processing. ArkVerse does not access or use user data for any purpose other than providing infrastructure support.

By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

### b. Plantation Data

- **Sapling Registration:** When you register a sapling, we collect details such as tree name, location, pincode, sponsorship status, sponsor name (if provided), and the date of plantation.
